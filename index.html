                    The robot had to move autonomously for 30 seconds, accomplishing a variety of tasks to score points for the team. Then,
                    the robot moved via remote controllers for the next minute and a half. I was in charge of programming the robot for 
                    both modes and making sure everything went as planned. Our robot made it to the quarterfinals of every tournament we 
                    participated in.</p></td>

                    over one weekend. Also, this was the first application I've worked on that had to communicate with the Pebble
